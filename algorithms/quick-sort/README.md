# Quick sort

Quicksort is a sorting algorithm based on the divide and conquer approach where:

1. An array is divided into subarrays by selecting a pivot element (element selected from the array). While dividing the array, the pivot element should be positioned in such a way that elements less than pivot are kept on the left side and elements greater than pivot are on the right side of the pivot.

2. The left and right subarrays are also divided using the same approach. This process continues until each subarray contains a single element.

3. At this point, elements are already sorted. Finally, elements are combined to form a sorted array.

- Time Complexity: Best: O(nlog n) | Worst: O(n2) | Average: O(nlog n)
- Space Complexity: O(log n)

## Algorithm

The quick sort algorithm can be described with the following steps:

1. If the range has fewer than two elements, return immediately as there is nothing to do. Possibly for other very short lengths a special-purpose sorting method is applied and the remainder of these steps skipped.

2. Otherwise pick a value, called a pivot, that occurs in the range (the precise manner of choosing depends on the partition routine, and can involve randomness).

3. Partition the range: reorder its elements, while determining a point of division, so that all elements with values less than the pivot come before the division, while all elements with values greater than the pivot come after it; elements that are equal to the pivot can go either way. Since at least one instance of the pivot is present, most partition routines ensure that the value that ends up at the point of division is equal to the pivot, and is now in its final position (but termination of quicksort does not depend on this, as long as sub-ranges strictly smaller than the original are produced).

4. Recursively apply the quicksort to the sub-range up to the point of division and to the sub-range after it, possibly excluding from both ranges the element equal to the pivot at the point of division. (If the partition produces a possibly larger sub-range near the boundary where all elements are known to be equal to the pivot, these can be excluded as well.)
