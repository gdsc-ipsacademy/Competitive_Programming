# Merge Sort

Merge Sort is a popular sorting algorithm known for its efficiency and stability. It operates by repeatedly dividing the unsorted list into sublists and then merging them back together.

- Time Complexity (TC): O(n log n)
- Space Complexity (SC): O(n)

## Algorithm

The Merge Sort algorithm follows these steps:

1. Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (initially).
2. Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining.

The merging process combines two sorted sublists into a single, sorted sublist.
