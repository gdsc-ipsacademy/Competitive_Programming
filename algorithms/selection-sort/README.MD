# Selection Sort

Selection sort is a straightforward and elementary comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly selecting the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and moving it to the beginning of the sorted portion. In each iteration, the unsorted portion shrinks by one element.

- Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst and average cases, where n is the number of elements to be sorted.
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## Algorithm

The selection sort algorithm can be described with the following steps:

1. Start with the entire unsorted array.
2. Find the minimum element in the unsorted portion.
3. Swap the found minimum element with the first element in the unsorted portion.
4. Move the boundary between the sorted and unsorted portions one element to the right.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the entire array is sorted.
